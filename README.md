# Natural-Language-Processing-Project

Hiya 

Im documenting my btech project thesis, and all the code, theory and analysis yada yada...

Its my first deep dive into NLP, hopefully something comes out of it

still not used to this VIM bullsh, but anyway we keep learning, one wrong letter and vim fucks up,

 

THe idea of this repo, is to upload these codes and the analysis of the various models that perform NLP tasks, they are specifically trained for Fakes news Detection purposes, 

The core of this project is to compare the results of BERT, RoBERTa, FastText + CNN and XLNET + Shap,the latter 2 of which have been uploaded to this repo for the time being 

Shap is an additional approach or rather provides an insight as to why the model gave a certain output

For now this is it
